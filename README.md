# Welcome to the Collaboratory
We are a group of students, alumni, and hobbyists cooperating on side projects to expand our skillsets and teamwork experience within the game development space.

Our goal as a group is to facilitate engaging projects that enable creators from multiple disciplines to bring their work together. To maximize accessibility we
base our workflow around open source or otherwise free game development tools. Our builds typically target WebGL using Unity to make our projects easy to share with
friends, colleagues, and recruiters. 

Check out our projects at [columcollaboratory.com](https://columcollaboratory.com/).
Inquiries about the group can be sent to `creators@columcollaboratory.com`.
